## Predictive Analytics for Customer Intent Using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on predicting customer purchase intent using a logistic regression model. It analyzes customer data, including age, shopping habits, past purchases, and interactions, to determine the likelihood of a purchase. The process involves data preparation, feature selection, and model training for classification. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability. The insights help businesses enhance marketing strategies, personalize recommendations, and improve customer experiences.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Understanding customer intent is essential for businesses to enhance engagement, optimize marketing strategies, and drive revenue growth. Traditional methods for predicting customer behavior relied on manual analysis or rule-based systems, which struggled with large datasets and rapidly changing consumer patterns. To address these limitations, this project leverages **logistic regression**, a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification, to predict whether a customer will make a purchase. Logistic regression establishes a relationship between input features—such as demographics, past transactions, browsing history, and product interactions—and the probability of an outcome using the **sigmoid function**. This enables businesses to analyze customer data effectively and gain actionable insights. The project follows a structured approach involving **data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation** using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By adopting a data-driven approach, businesses can improve customer engagement through **personalized recommendations, targeted marketing, and better decision-making**. Logistic regression’s simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency make it a preferred choice for small to medium-sized datasets, ensuring reliable predictions. The insights from this model help businesses optimize their strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and stay competitive in an evolving market. Ultimately, this project highlights the power of **predictive analytics** in transforming customer interactions and supporting data-driven business growth.
